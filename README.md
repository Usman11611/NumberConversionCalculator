# NumberConversionCalculator
I developed a Python calculator that converts numbers between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal formats. It not only performs the conversions but also displays the steps involved, making the process transparent and easy to follow. This tool is ideal for learning number systems or validating calculations in various numeral bases.
